# CHANGELOG

## v3.2.0

### What's New?

- Add a container image to ship the single-page application (SPA) build of the console: `openziti/ziti-console:3.2.0` (also `:v3` and `:latest`). The tag scheme follows the Git version of each release. See [the deployment guide](https://openziti.io/docs/guides/deployments/docker/console) for more information.
